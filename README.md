Details
-------
ImageS3 is an outstanding image resizing and hosting service. Based on Amazon S3 for maximal reliability, it works as a private cloud service specialized in resizing and storing images for software applications. Developers can easily set up ImageS3 service and let it connect to Amazon S3, then enjoy unlimited image uploading, hosting, resizing and retrieving. More details about ImageS3 can be found from http://images3.com/ and https://github.com/images3/images3-play.

ImageS3Android is a SDK for developing Android applications that consume ImageS3 service. It wraps service calls and data structures and makes integration dramatically simple.

The SDK works as an application SDK, meaning that you can include it as a library, change some configurations, and get a fully working Android application without writing any code. Of course, you can integrate components it provides into your application and build richer functionality for end users.

This SDK provides the following features:
* Take pictures and upload to ImageS3 service.
* Pick images from gallery and upload to ImageS3 service.
* Browse images on multiple pages.
* Browse images of different sizes.
* Save images into gallery.
* Set images as wallpaper.
* Delete images.
* Automatically detect image changes in image plant.

All these features are built around the concepts of ImagePlant and Template. Refer to ImageS3's documentation for understanding these concepts.

Administration of image plants and templates can be included in the SDK but it is not necessary to do this on mobile devices. Usually a developer can create image plants and templates from Web admin dashboard on a computer. On mobile device the major work is creating and uploading images and browsing images.

Usage
-----

In order to utilize this library, you just need to do some configurations without writing any code.
* Import all the three projects into workspace: android-support-v7-support, AndroidViewPageIndicator and ImageS3AndroidSDK. You can also get android-support-v7-support from Android SDK. The other one, ImageS3AndroidDemo, is an app showing how to use this library.
* In your application, include ```ImageS3AndroidSDK``` as library.
* In your application's ```AndroidManifest.xml```, make sure that you have the following permissions:
  * ```android.permission.INTERNET```
  * ```android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE```
  * ```android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE```
  * ```android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE```
  * ```android.permission.CAMERA```
  * ```android.permission.SET_WALLPAPER```
  * ```com.android.launcher.permission.INSTALL_SHORTCUT```
* In your application's ```AndroidManifest.xml```, include two activities:
  * ```com.wms.opensource.images3android.activity.UploadImageActivity```
  * ```com.wms.opensource.images3android.activity.ImageListFragmentActivity```
* In your applications' ```res/values/strings.xml```,
  * Set ```ImageS3ServiceURL``` which is the URL of your ImageS3 service. Your application won't work without this being properly set.
  * Set ```imagePlantId``` which is the id of the image plant used for your application. Your application won't work without this being properly set.
